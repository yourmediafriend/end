## Server Side Rendering

* It does not handle rendering images correctly when using imports, which need Webpack in order to work (and which complicates the process a lot)
* It does not handle page header metadata, which is essential for SEO and social sharing purposes (among other things)
* So while this is a good example of using ReactDOMServer.renderToString() and ReactDOM.hydrate to get this basic server-side rendering, itâ€™s not enough for real world usage.

### `npm run build`
### `node server/index.js`
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
